## Summary

I am a dedicated and skilled Frontend Developer with over 3 years of hands-on experience in developing front-end web applications. My expertise lies in utilizing React and Redux to manage state efficiently, as well as creating visually appealing designs using Figma.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Mechatronics at LVT, which has provided me with a solid foundation in both software and hardware engineering principles. My multilingual abilities in Russian, Latvian, and English allow me to communicate effectively with diverse teams and clients.
